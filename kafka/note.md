This repo discusses some techniques of consuming kafka (Sync, Batch, MultiAsync and MultiBatch) and try to demonstrate some best practices which I think would be generally useful to consume data efficiently.

* Sync: consume messages one by one
* Batch: consume messages batch by batch
* MultiAsync: the "Fan In / Fan Out" pattern
* MultiBatch: the "Fan In / Fan Out" pattern batch by batch
